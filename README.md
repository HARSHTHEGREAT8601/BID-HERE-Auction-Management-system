# BID-HERE-Auction-Management-system
This is my Group project in which i have used C++ programming langauge.
Used Linked lists,maps,sets and other auxiliary Data Structures to implement in project.
â€¢ The system tells about Highest Bid Date-wise ,about Money left in purse ,about the list of sold and unsold items ,and at the end gives Summary of entire Auction.
The person which helped me with this projeect :Harsh Agarwal(IIT Bombay)
